# WhatsApp clone

This is a WhatsApp clone made using MERN stack and ui library MIUI, currently working on the frontend of the application, with focus on making the ui as close to the original as possible with with slight design changes inpired from the mobile interface. with little inconsistency on the scroll bar part as i go forward with this project i tend to learn new stuff, and apply them and make changes, in the for of optimising code or new feature. As i am in the process of learning backend, things are to come a bit slow.
